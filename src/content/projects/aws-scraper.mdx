![Scraper tool](/projects/aws-scraper.png)

The application consists of two modules: client and serverless. 
The client module primarily utilizes React and TypeScript, 
while the serverless module is built in JavaScript using the Puppeteer library and AWS Lambda. 
The purpose of the application is to scrape articles based on a user-provided keyword.

It was originally deployed to AWS and used Lambda functions to trigger the puppeteer script 
but my free tier ended so i shut it down.
